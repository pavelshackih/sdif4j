sdif4j is a Simple Dependency Injection Facade for Java
======

This project aims to encapsulate different dependency injection frameworks with own abstraction.
It can be helpful on developing frameworks or any reusable in DI context code.

Currently supported frameworks:
* Google Guice (3.0+)
* Spring (3.0+)
* PicoContainer (work in progress)
* JavaEE CDI (JavaEE 6+) (work in progress)

All of it support JSR-330, but in different ways.

You can find examples in sdif4j-testing* subprojects.
